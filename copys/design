create a dashboard for managing the Neptuno API, focusing on its gamification, authentication, configuration, and coupon features. This will be a comprehensive admin interface that allows users to interact with all available endpoints while also providing a user dashboard for testing the gamification elements.

The design evokes modern SaaS dashboards like Stripe, Supabase, or Firebase console, with a clean, professional interface featuring:

Design Inspiration:

    Clear navigation with a sidebar for all API categories
    Interactive API explorer similar to Swagger UI but more polished
    User and admin dashboards with data visualization
    Gamification elements (points, badges, levels) prominently displayed

Color Palette & Styling:

    Primary colors: Deep navy (#0F172A), Vibrant blue (#3B82F6)
    Secondary accent: Teal (#0EA5E9)
    Warm accents: Amber (#F59E0B) for gamification elements
    Clean white space with subtle shadows and rounded corners
    Monospace fonts for code/API samples, modern sans-serif for UI


Refine & Customize: Tweak the design, animations, and layouts via prompts or visual edits.
