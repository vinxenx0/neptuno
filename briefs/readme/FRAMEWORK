1. Why It’s a Boilerplate (Not a Framework)

    Pre-configured Setup: It includes a backend (Python-based, likely FastAPI/Flask) and frontend (Next.js) with predefined routes, models, and services.

    No Framework-like Abstraction:

        A framework (e.g., Django, Next.js) provides rules, patterns, and extensibility (e.g., middleware systems, plugin architectures).

        Your project is structured but doesn’t enforce a strict development paradigm (like MVC, Dependency Injection, etc.).

    Reusable but Not Extensible:

        Boilerplate = Ready-to-use code for quick starts.

        Framework = Allows developers to extend core behavior (e.g., adding custom middleware in Express.js).

        

    A core SDK/API that others can extend,

    Convention-over-configuration rules,

    Custom tooling for scaffolding.
